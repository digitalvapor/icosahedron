#[Icosahedron](https://github.com/digitalvapor/icosahedron)

A [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) theme made for [DigitalVapor](http://antivapor.net) that uses [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) and polyhedra to make a responsive theme that looks just as great on mobile and extremely large screens.
